Istructions:

- unzip folder or clone it
- put the folder in the /mods folder of tera toolbox
- in the /assets folder put an executable shortcut for obs with the `--startstreaming` cmd at the end of the "Target" field (eg. `"C:\Program Files\obs-studio\bin\64bit\obs64.exe" --startstreaming`) and name it "obs_executable_shortcut.lnk"
- launch the game
- to get a list of available commands type `/8 obs help` in game

Note: `/node_modules` sadly needs to be pushed in the repo because tera-toolbox doesn't support installing dependencies automatically..
